        Update dune related files (thanks to Gabriel Radanne).
        Fixed file descriptor leakage (read pipe end not closed in mapper), reported by Julia Lawall.

        Include fix in bytearray.ml to avoid corruption on 32bit architectures
        (drops support for OCaml 4.02.3, thanks to Jerry James)

        Major enhancement: add support for returning results in the right order from
        the calls to parmap/parmapi/array_parmap/array_parmapi even when the
	chunksize parameter is used. This can be accomplished using the keeporder
	parameter.
	Documentation, tests and functions parameters updated accordingly.

2020/01/23 (RDC)
	Integrated major rewriting of the build system, moving to dune;
	dropped compatibility with pre-4.02 OCaml versions. Thanks to Gabriel Radanne.

        Version 0.9.8 contains the following major new features w.r.t. 0.9.4
           - a chunksize parameter can be used to control the granularity of the
             parallelism: each worker will handle a series of chunks of this size
             and ask for them when ready, thus allowing the system to achieve
             automatic load balancing
           - very specialised versions of the map function are now available for
             arrays and float arrays, allowing to obtain significant speed-up even
             on relatively light computations
           - autoconf and ocamlbuild harness should simplify compilation and installation.

        internally convert lists to array to avoid quadratic penalty in execution time on long lists,
        thanks to Paul Vernaza <pvernaza@andrew.cmu.edu> for pointing out this issue;
        added 'a sequence type to allow using efficiently the library both with lists and arrays.
